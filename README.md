# simple-hand-game
This is a simple hand game popularly called Rock Paper Scissors.
Physically this is played between two persons who face each other choosing to be either a rock, paper or scissors.
To play, both players must agree when to shoot, but here we will be playing on the console.
All you need to do is choose to be a rock paper or scissors and wait to see if you win or lose.
Enjoy!
